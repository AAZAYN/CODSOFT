# Machine Learning Classification Tasks

This repository contains datasets and Python code to solve classification tasks using machine learning. It includes two main folders:

## Folders

### `datasets/`
- Contains the datasets for all three tasks. Each dataset is stored in a separate file for easy access.

### `notebooks/`
- Contains Jupyter notebooks with Python code to solve the predictive modelling problems using different machine learning algorithms. The notebooks are organized by task.
